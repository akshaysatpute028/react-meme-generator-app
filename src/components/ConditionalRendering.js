/*
1. What is "conditional rendering"?
When we want to only sometimes display something on the page
based on a condition of some sort


2. When would you use &&?
When you want to either display something or NOT display it


3. When would you use a ternary?
When you need to decide which thing among 2 options to display


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
Use an `if...else if... else` conditional or a `switch` statement
